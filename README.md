This repository contains a tutorial for the methods in and replication code for TITLE (AUTHORS Dee, Ferraro, Severen, et al).

### Tutorial Instructions

Please provide instructions for accessing and using the tutorial HERE.

### Replication Instructions

The analysis for this project was done in R and Stata, with the majority in R. Below, under *Provenance of Results*, is a list of all results in the paper and supplemental materials and where the authoritative version can be found. 

R Replication Instructions: Set cdir to your local repo location. Note that only *comb* data is included; *cover* is larger and must be obtained separately, and requires settings its own path.

Stata Replication Insructions: Set the global macros to local repo location.
